Scripts that do things I need or want

MY CREATIONS:

          it to newsboat urls config. Prompts for multiple submissions. File path can be 
          modified to your liking. 

yt-plist-run - opens given youtube playlist with any flags added with fzf. use tab to multi-
                      select, enter when finished with selections.
                      
yt-runV2 - operates similarly to youtube-plist-run, but prompts for search terms after flags
           are chosen, allows editing of flags in editor before running.
