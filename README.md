Very Simple Bash Scripts
=====================================

## Most of these are messy, unfinished scripts I've mainly used for learning purposes. 
## I do actually use quite a few of them day to day, but remember to use at your own risk.

### yt2rss 
  - Will prompt for a youtube video url, using youtube-viewer the channel id of the uploader
  is pulled and added to the bottom of your newsboat url list. Will prompt for another 
  submission after each submit.
    
### memused 
  - display current RAM usage, ram metrics pulled from 'free' command

### batterycap 
  - very simple battery capacity output, lackluster implementation of a low battery 
  notification <- I need to spend more than 2 minutes on it next time

### blockh
  - gets current btc blockchain height using blockcypher api

### btc 
  - outputs current price of 1 bitcoin, wrapper for a small python script that calls to
  coindesk api

### bluetooth 
  - lists currently connected bluetooth device

### bluebuds 
  - quick connect to my galaxy buds, could probably configure for your own devices

### status 
  - simple status bar using xsetroot -name, simply displays info from several of the 
  other scripts within the top right of dwm
  - inspired by dwm_sss by git@joeiddon
            
### pkglister 
  - just creates backup txt files of my currently installed packages, explicitely 
  installed packages, aur packages, non-dependent packages and a list of the size 
  of each package sorted by size

### dmenu_bookmarks 
  - reads bookmarks from a url file in dmenu, launches to specified browser

### dmenu_scripts 
  - dmenu script to run other scripts through the dmenu

### monitors 
  - just sets xrandr

### xset-noblank 
  - turns off screen blanking

### list-repos 
  - list of directories where my active repos are - shows current git status 
  (does not show all system repos, just select repos)
